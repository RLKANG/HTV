Motivation Calendar

Inspiration
Sometimes it can be hard to beat procrastination. 
With Motivation Calendar, you will be able to feel good about monitoring and completing your to-dos and leaving time for your leisure activities.

What it does
Users can enter tasks and points which can then be completed, indicated by checking the box, to claim points. Then they may go into the desires tab to enter desires and points which can be redeemed by having sufficient points.

What's next for Motivation Calendar
To implement the full calendar view and also give users the options of selecting certain tasks/desires happening at a certain frequency, i.e Homework everyday at 4:00pm, etc. In the long run, we wish to make a parent-child version of the app, where the parent controls the tasks and its points and the child can claim their desires and leisure time by completing certain tasks.
